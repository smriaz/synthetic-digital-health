# OSWDH v1.0 — Dataset Card (Draft)

**Summary:** OSWDH is a fully synthetic, mechanism-driven wearable digital health dataset for benchmarking time-series ML, explainable AI, federated learning, and agentic decision-making. It includes daily and minute-level wearable features, clinical-lite events, outcomes across five tracks, public ground-truth latent states, and event explanation objects.

**Synthetic nature:** All records are generated. No real individuals or PHI.

**Intended uses:** benchmarking robustness, XAI fidelity, FL under non-IID, offline policy evaluation.

**Prohibited uses:** clinical diagnosis, claims about real populations, deployment without external validation.

**Licensing:** Code (Apache-2.0). Dataset outputs (CC BY-NC 4.0).
